# SMS-Spam-Classification-Using-NLP-and-Machine-Learning

 overview of the SMS Spam Classification using NLP and Machine Learning process:

1. Data Collection:
     Use an SMS dataset labeled as "ham" (not spam) or "spam" (unwanted messages). Example: SMS Spam Collection dataset.
2. Data Preprocessing:
   Text Cleaning: Remove noise like special characters, punctuation, and stop words.
   Tokenization: Break down text into individual words (tokens).
   Vectorization: Convert text into a numerical format using Bag of Words (BoW) or TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   Analyze and visualize data distribution.
   Common tools: word clouds, frequency charts to detect patterns in spam/ham messages.
4. Model Building:
   Use classifiers like:
   Naive Bayes: Common for text classification due to simplicity and effectiveness.
   Logistic Regression or SVM: Alternatives for robust classification.
   Split data into training and test sets (e.g., 80/20 split).
5. Model Training:
   Train the classifier using the vectorized data.
   Fine-tune model parameters.
6. Model Evaluation:
   Measure performance using metrics such as:
   Accuracy: Overall correctness.
   Precision: Spam detection accuracy.
   Recall: Coverage of actual spam messages.
   F1-Score: Balance between precision and recall.
7. Fine-Tuning and Optimization:
   Adjust feature extraction techniques, try different algorithms, or apply cross-validation for better results.
8. Final Results:
   High-performing models achieve metrics like:
   Accuracy: ~98%
   Precision: ~99%
   Recall: ~98%
This overview covers the essentials of building an SMS spam classifier, highlighting key steps in data processing, model training, and evaluation using machine learning and NLP techniques.
